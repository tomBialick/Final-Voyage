# Final-Voyage

This is a java game I started in high school. I am semi proud of it, but it is littered with bad coding habits since 
I was attempting something I had no idea how to do from scratch. Feel free to look through it, though it is a bit messy.  

It was inspired from Asteroids and a little bit from a Star Trek game on the Game Boy. If there is actual interest in this 
project, or if I resume development on it, I will completely expand this README, clean up the code, and create a planned 
features/how to contribute section.
